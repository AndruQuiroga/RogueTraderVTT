# Righteous Fury Quick Reference

## What is Righteous Fury?

Righteous Fury (also called Zealous Hatred in some contexts) represents a devastating, critical hit that can turn the tide of battle. When you roll maximum damage, your Emperor-blessed strike may deal extra damage and cause horrific critical injuries.

## How It Works

### 1. Trigger Condition

Righteous Fury triggers when you roll a **natural 10** on a damage die (d10).

**Special Cases:**

-   **Gauss weapons**: Trigger on **9 or 10**
-   **Vengeful(X) weapons**: Trigger on **X or higher**

### 2. Confirmation Roll

When RF triggers, a dialog appears showing:

-   The weapon that caused the hit
-   Which characteristic to test (WS for melee, BS for ranged)
-   Your target number

Click **"Roll Confirmation"** to make a d100 test.

### 3. Results

#### ✅ Confirmed (Roll ≤ Target)

-   **+1d10 bonus damage** (added to hit total)
-   **Critical Effect** applied (rolled on critical tables)
-   Deathdealer talent bonus applies (if you have it)
-   Chat card glows with golden animation

#### ❌ Not Confirmed (Roll > Target)

-   No bonus damage
-   No critical effect
-   Hit still counts as normal
-   Chat card shows "not confirmed"

## Weapon Qualities

### Gauss

_Necron technology that strips matter at the molecular level_

-   RF triggers on **9 or 10** (instead of just 10)
-   Example: Gauss Flayer, Gauss Blaster

### Vengeful(X)

_Wrathful weapons that channel righteous anger_

-   RF triggers on **X or higher**
-   Example: Vengeful(8) triggers on 8, 9, or 10
-   If you have both Gauss and Vengeful, uses the **lower** threshold

## Examples

### Example 1: Standard Bolter

1. Roll damage: `1d10+5` = **10** + 5 = 15 damage
2. RF triggers! (rolled natural 10)
3. Confirmation test: BS 45 → Roll d100 = **32** ✅
4. Bonus damage: 1d10 = **7**
5. Total: 15 + 7 = **22 damage**
6. Critical: Roll 1d5 = **3** → "Severed limb" effect

### Example 2: Gauss Weapon

1. Roll damage: `1d10+3` = **9** + 3 = 12 damage
2. RF triggers! (Gauss triggers on 9)
3. Confirmation test: BS 38 → Roll d100 = **52** ❌
4. Total: **12 damage** (no bonus)
5. No critical effect

### Example 3: Vengeful(8) Power Sword

1. Roll damage: `1d10+8` = **8** + 8 = 16 damage
2. RF triggers! (Vengeful(8) triggers on 8+)
3. Confirmation test: WS 52 → Roll d100 = **18** ✅
4. Bonus damage: 1d10 = **9**
5. Total: 16 + 9 = **25 damage**
6. Critical: Roll 1d5 = **4** → "Massive trauma" effect

## Tips for Players

✅ **DO:**

-   Pray for natural 10s (or 9s with Gauss)
-   Invest in high WS/BS for better confirmation
-   Use RF-prone weapons on important targets
-   Celebrate confirmed RFs dramatically!

❌ **DON'T:**

-   Forget to check for Gauss/Vengeful qualities
-   Skip the confirmation dialog
-   Waste Fate Points before seeing RF results
-   Expect RF on non-d10 weapons

## Tips for GMs

### Balancing

-   NPCs with Touched by the Fates trait can trigger RF
-   Hordes typically cannot trigger RF (per trait)
-   Boss enemies should have high characteristics (harder to confirm)
-   Give players with Deathdealer bonus damage on confirmed RF

### Pacing

-   RF adds dramatic moments - let players enjoy them
-   For minions, consider auto-confirming to speed combat
-   For boss fights, make confirmations tense

### Rewards

-   Vengeful weapons are powerful but rare
-   Gauss weapons should be Necron tech (very rare, heretical)
-   Consider RF statistics for end-of-session awards

## Talents That Interact

### Deathdealer (Melee/Ranged)

-   On **confirmed** RF, add Perception Bonus to damage
-   Doubles the impact of lucky strikes
-   Stacks with the +1d10 bonus

### Crushing Blow / Mighty Shot

-   These add damage to base roll
-   Higher base damage increases chance of triggering Primitive/Proven
-   Does NOT affect RF threshold (still need natural 10)

### Touched by the Fates

-   NPCs with this trait can trigger RF
-   Usually reserved for significant enemies
-   Gives NPCs Fate Points and RF capability

## Critical Effects

When RF is confirmed, roll 1d5 to determine severity:

1. Minor injury (bleeding, dazed)
2. Moderate injury (broken bone, burned)
3. Serious injury (severed finger, blinded)
4. Major injury (severed limb, organ damage)
5. Devastating injury (decapitation, death)

Effects vary by:

-   **Damage Type**: Impact, Rending, Explosive, Energy
-   **Hit Location**: Head, Body, Arm, Leg

See Core Rulebook p.251-255 for full tables.

## FAQ

**Q: Can I trigger RF multiple times in one attack?**
A: Yes! If you roll multiple d10s (e.g., "2d10" damage), each natural 10 triggers RF separately.

**Q: Does Tearing affect RF?**
A: No. Tearing lets you re-roll 1s and 2s, but RF is based on the **final** die result.

**Q: Can I use Fate to reroll the confirmation?**
A: Ask your GM. RAW doesn't specify, but it's reasonable.

**Q: Do weapon modifiers affect RF threshold?**
A: No. RF is based on the **natural die roll**, not modified damage.

**Q: Can psychic powers trigger RF?**
A: Yes, if the power's damage is a d10 roll.

**Q: What if I have both Gauss and Vengeful(10)?**
A: System uses the **lower** threshold. Gauss (9) takes priority.

**Q: Does RF work on vehicles/starships?**
A: Currently implemented for personal combat. Vehicle/starship RF is GM discretion.
