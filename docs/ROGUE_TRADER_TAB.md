# Rogue Trader Tab

The Acolyte sheet now includes a **Rogue Trader** tab that surfaces key Rogue Trader details on the Dark Heresy–style sheet. The tab exposes fields for:

- **Identity:** career path, rank, home world, and motivation.
- **Profit Factor:** starting value, current value, and any misfortunes.
- **Lifting & Armour:** lift, carry, and push thresholds plus armour weight tracking.
- **Notes:** freeform acquisitions and mutations text areas.

All data is stored under `system.rogueTrader.*` with safe defaults in the actor template and is ready for further rule integrations without migrations.
