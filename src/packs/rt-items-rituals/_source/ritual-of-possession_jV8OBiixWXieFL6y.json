If possessing an NPC, if the daemon's WP is lower than the NPC's then the NPC lasts their WP Bonus hours, if the Daemon's WP is higher than the host then the host lasts half their WP Bonus hours. When time runs out the Daemon either bursts out from the host or returns to the warp, leaving the host scarred mentally and physically but alive.",
