For example, looking at a lock and using the power to find a key, or finding a person they know the face of would work, but simply finding a key or unknwon person with no other reference would not. The degree of precision as to the location increases with more Degrees of Success: 0 DoF: Rough Direction, 2 DoF: Specific Direction, and roughly how far away. 4 DoF: Specific direction and exactly how far away. Finally, consider further modifiers to focus power Test: +10 if intimately familiar with target, +5 if posessing a portion of target (lock of hair, fragment, etc), +5 if target within 50 metres, -10 if in a crowd of similar targets, -20 if target over 2km away.",
