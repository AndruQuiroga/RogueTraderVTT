If target is a person, the character must have seen the person before (pictures count) or know their name in order to find them. Character then makes a Psyniscience test modified by the following: +10, intimiately familiar with subject (object carreid for a long time, person known well). +5, posessing a portion of the target (lock of hair, stone from a statue, etc). +5, target is within 100m. -10, target is more than 500m away. -10, target is surrounded by others of its kind (person in a crowd, key on a keyring).  If target is within range test reveals location: 0 DoS: Rough Direction, 1 DoS: Specific Direction and roughly how far. 2-3 DoS: Specific Direction, exactly how far. 4+ DoS: visual image of current location of target, as well as previous results.
