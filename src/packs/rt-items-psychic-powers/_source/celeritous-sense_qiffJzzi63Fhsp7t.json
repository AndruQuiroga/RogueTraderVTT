They inflict Zealous Hatred/Righteous Fury on a roll of 9 or 10.\nThey can also detect stimuli that are normally far too insignificant to be noticed (such as whispered words from a hundreds of metres away, or the indiviudal blades on a properller), or that would be subsumed amidst other noise (such as picking out a specific location on a complex map, a specific person from a crowd, eavesdropping on a conversation in the middle of a battle, etc). The exact bounds are subject to the GM.\nThe Fickle Nature of Chaos may see it that only fragments of information are caught as opposed to a full conversation if it is especially plot important.",
