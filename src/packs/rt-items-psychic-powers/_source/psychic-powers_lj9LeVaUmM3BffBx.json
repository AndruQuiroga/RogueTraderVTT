After choosing, make Focus Power Test with +5 to Test per Psy Rating (remember effects of Fettered/Pushing). Roll of 91+ is always a fail. \nUsing powers above Fettered Level may cause Psychic Phenomena. Occuring if an Unfettered Focus Power Test rolls a double, or whenever Pushing a Psychic power which also adds +5 to Psychic Phenomena Roll per Psy Rating added (up to Psy +3/+15 to roll).\nSustaining powers is free unless stated otherwise (only ever one action to sustain all powers), sustaining multiple powers adds +10 to Psychic Phenomena and -1 Psy Rating per sustained power. Psy Rating can affect powers, this is the Effective Psy Rating After any bonuses/penalties, such as halving from Fettered or +'s from Push.\nPsychic Bolts are like standard ranged weapon attacks, Barrages and Storms like Semi and Full Auto attacks with a max rate of fire equal to Psy Rating, and Blasts like Area of Effect Attacks, they can all be dodged in the same ways.",
