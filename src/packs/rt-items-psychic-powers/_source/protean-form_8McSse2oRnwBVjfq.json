Traits with a number can be taken multiple times, each time after the first adding +1 to the number. The Psyker also gains the Warp Instability Trait, if they reach 0 wounds the power ends and they are stunned until the end of their next turn. Traits remain as long as power is sustained.\nIf this Power causes Psychic Phenomena, at the start of each of the psyker's turns that this power is sustained, roll psychic phenomena and apply the result (reroll if 75+, second roll stands however).",
