Psyker gains +10 per 2 Psy Rating devoted to power and delves deeper into target's mind with every 2 DoS. If target wins, reprogramming is rejected, Psyker gains 1 Fatigue, and cannot re-attempt for 1d5 hours. Target is always aware their mind is being reordered until the process is complete. Effects of Reprogramming are permenant if successful, unless a situation leads to a paradox. A Paradox, such as being faced by evidence or major discrepencies may cause target to make -20 Willpower Test, if successful, programming breaks down. If failed, victim keeps believing, either case causes 1d10 Insanity. See \"Reprogramming\" box for more info on levels.",
