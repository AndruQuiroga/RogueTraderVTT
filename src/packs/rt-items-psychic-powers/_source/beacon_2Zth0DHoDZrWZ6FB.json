Navigators who know the beacon's existence and get at least one degree of success on a -10 Psyniscience Test can also detect and locate it from a distance 1 Light Year x your Psy Rating. By knowing the location of and successful sensing the beacon, they may in place of locating the Astronomicon make a -30 Navigation (Warp) Test using the beacon to chart a successful course through the warp. This beacon may become obscured by warp storms or otherwise destroyed.\nHB: Just make it a -20 Psyniscience test to successfully locate rather than mess around with \"1 degree of success\", because otherwise you can pass test with 0 DoS but not actually get anything.",
