If the Psyker wins opposed test, he prevents all damage that would have been caused by the attack would have dealt. If succeeding by 2+ Degrees of Success, the damage is returned to the attacker as an amount of Energy Damage equal to the amount of damage prevented, with Penetration 0. \nNote: If attacker is making multiple attacks, this technique likely only blocks one of the attacks.",
