When activating this power with a focus power test, all allies within Psy Rating metres, except the psyker themselves, gain +10 to their Willpower Characteristic for as long as Psyker Sustains power. If Psyker gets 3+ Degrees of Success on Focus Power Test, allies can also reroll any failed tests to resist Fear.\nNote: Inconsistent stated range in range category and description. Either \"Range\" is range at which power is deployed, at which point it acts as a bubble of range Psy Rating metres. Otherwise, acts as bubble of Psy Rating metres radius surrounding psyker, and 10m x Psy Rating is an error.",
