Anyone with Resistance (Psychic Powers) inflicts -10 on Test (only once). 1 DoS: Crude impression of number of concious minds in range and General position relative to them. 2 DoS: Psyker knows number, general location, and \"Strength\" of minds within area, can determine if any are Psykers with +0 Psyniscience Test. 3 DoS: Same as 2 DoS, but Psyker can make Telepathic Communication with any in area. 4+ DoS: Same as 3 DoS, but Psyker may attempt a \"Mind Probe\" Power on one sensed in the area.
