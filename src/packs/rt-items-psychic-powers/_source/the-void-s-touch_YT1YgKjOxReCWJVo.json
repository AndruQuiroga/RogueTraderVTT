This attack can be dodged, but target has -5 to dodge test per Degree of Success psyker scored on Focus Power Test if target is still touching connecting surface at the end of the dodge. If the target suffers damage from this attack after armour and toughness, they make +0 Toughness Test or halve their movement rate (round up) until the end of the next round. As this power requires a connecting surface, it is ineffective if there is not one (such as vs a flying target).",
