If the psyke chooses not to make a Lightning Attack, the power ends prematurely. Regardless, when the power ends the Psyker gains 1d5 Fatigue.\nIf this power triggers Psychic Phenomena, in addition to its normal effects all Heavily damaged creatures within 30m of the Psyker gain one level of Fatigue.",
