Touch: Psyker can \"see\" any objects they touch regardless of available light, EG: running fingers across embossed lettering to read it. Taste: can make a +0 Awareness Test prior to swalling any consumable, assuming it is not laced with an overwhelming poison dose, if they pass the test they can detect any poison and spit the food back out before it takes effect.\nPower lasts for Psy Rating Rounds, can be activated multiple times to gain different sense effects (although the +30 bonus doesn't stack). The Psyker can, instead of gaining any of the bonuses here, turn off one of their senses using this power.",
