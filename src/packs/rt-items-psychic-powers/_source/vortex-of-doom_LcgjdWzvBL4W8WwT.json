The Psyker cannot willingly end the power, instead they must a +0 Willpower Test with -5 per metre the Vortex's Radius is. If they pass they can do one of: Increase Radius by 1 Metre, Decrease Radius by 1 Metre or Move the Vortex Psy Rating Metres in any direction. If failing the Vortex grows one metre and moves Psy Rating metres in a random direction. If reaching zero metres, power ends, if reaching more than Psy Rating Metres Radius Vortex explodes, doing 2d10 +4xPsy Rating Energy Damage with Pen Vortex Radius to anyone within 2xPsy Rating metres of vortex centre. The Psyker also takes this damage, regardless of proximity.",
