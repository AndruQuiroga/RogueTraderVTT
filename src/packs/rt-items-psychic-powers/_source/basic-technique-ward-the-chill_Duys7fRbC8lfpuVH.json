A Successful Focus Power Test creates a bubble of warmth and air which allows the psyker to survive unprotected in a vacuum for Psy Rating number of hours. Every Degree of Success allows the psyker to protect one additional person within the bubble for the power's duration.\nNote: The bubble, presumably, has a radius equal to the power's range, and moves with the Psyker, although this isn't stated directly.",
