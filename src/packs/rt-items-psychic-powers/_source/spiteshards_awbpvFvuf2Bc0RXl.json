These are then fired at a target and hit automatically, although can be dodged as with a ranged attack. Each shard does 1d5 + Psy Rating Damage, Penetration 5+Psy Rating. Creatures that stuffer damage after Armour and Toughness from this must make +0 Willpower Test or gain 1d5 Corruption. The Psyker gains 1d5-2 Corruption (minimum 0) whenever they manifest this power.",
