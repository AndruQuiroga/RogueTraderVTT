These targets will now manifest Nurgle's Rot, effecting all targets within Psy Rating Metres of them. A Target can only be affected by one area of effect of Nurgle's Rot at a time if multiple were to overlap. This power is sustained for as long as Nurgle's Rot is sustained, and ends when it does. (still counts as sustaining two powers).",
