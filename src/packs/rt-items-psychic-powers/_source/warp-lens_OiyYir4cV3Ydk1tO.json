However GM secretly rolls 1d10+Psy Rating, after that number of minutes of using the power, the vision may or may not become tainted, erroneous, or completely false at GM's discretion. The Psyker may only use this power once per hour.\nNote: For thematic convenience, after secret time is up, each minute GM secretly makes Willpower tests for Psyker, with each failiure (and degree of failiure), vision becomes progressively more fake. Progressing from minor errors, to completley false (over 10+ collective DoF)  in which ever way is most inconvenient for the psyker.",
