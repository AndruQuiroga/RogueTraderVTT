The Psyker may lift or move any object within range and line of sight that does not exceed 10kg x Psy Rating. Heavy Objects do not move fast enough to damage someone, and when released, will slowly settle back to the surface. Objects 5kg x Psy Rating or Lighter however can be fired up to 5m x Psy Rating, to hit something with it, Psyker makes Ballistic Skill Test, with missile doing 1d10 Impact damage, +1 per 5kg of fired objects weight. Neither of these effects work against living things. However, Psyker can instead unleash a wave of force to shove any target, living or not, requiring Opposed Willpower vs Target's Strength, if passed, target is knocked to the ground and pushed 1m x Psy Rating.",
