It can be a shield against the greatest of foes, or a tool to uncover yet greater secrets, or even a holy thing in its own right... but it can also be damning. Those who seek knowledge must be wary, for their greed and curiosity can lead them down treacherous paths. Some things, after all, are not meant to be known.</p><h3>Advanced Origin Rules</h3><p>This origin path contains three powerful options, each with an associated Experience Point cost.

There is no ulterior motive to your drive to understand, no hidden purpose to give that curiosity a focus. You simply crave knowledge with every fibre of your being, and you cannot stand the idea of not knowing or not understanding something. Though new insights and revelations cannot hope to sate this bottomless urge, new understanding brings with it new power and new means with which to find yet more knowledge. Each answer leads to still more questions, and every new vista promises a variety of secrets yet to be uncovered.",
