When Inquisitors compile their lists of suspected heretics, your bloodline features prominently. Confessors preach sermons warning against your family's corruption. In some sectors, your very name is enough to turn allies into enemies and close doors that should remain open.</p><p>The taint runs deep. Perhaps it began with a single ancestor who dabbled in forbidden lore. Perhaps an entire generation fell to Chaos during the Heresy. Perhaps your family made pacts with xenos or trafficked in archaeotech better left buried. Whatever the source, the stain cannot be easily washed away.</p><h3>Three Paths</h3><p>You stand at a crossroads. Will you reject your family's evil and seek redemption? Will you hide the worst of it, maintaining a facade of respectability while pursuing your own dark agenda? Or will you embrace the forbidden knowledge your family has accumulated, using it as a weapon regardless of the cost to your soul?</p><p><strong>Cost:</strong> This lineage option costs XP to be taken from starting XP at character creation. Choose one of three paths that define your relationship to your family's corruption.</p>"
