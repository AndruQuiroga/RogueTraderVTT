Scripture, ritual, lessons, and priestly exhortations fill your memories, rising unbidden in every quiet moment—as though the aged, white-haired clerics who taught you still remain by your shoulder in spirit, jealously guarding over your soul.</p><p>All men hear the God-Emperor's words if they are born and raised in the right fashion, shaped by devotion from youth into adulthood.</p>"
