True duty arises spontaneously from the soul, a call to service and struggle that should be neither shirked nor denied.\"</em></p></blockquote><p>It is your faith and your honour that impels you to places and labours far beyond the imagining of those that grub in the dirt of self-interest. Whether you serve the Aquila, strive to guide and guard the numberless masses of mankind, or serve the honour and calling of your blood, you know well the great trials and far journeys that lie ahead, and intend to see them through to the last.</p><p>Your sense of duty defines you, and you would rather die than abandon those you are sworn to protect or the ideals you hold sacred.</p>"
