Famine, plague, and other unlooked-for disasters kill the weak, can make death a mercy, and often destroy the thin veneer of civilisation worn by many, revealing both the worst and best in humanity.\"</em></p></blockquote><p>You have seen all this and more, and perhaps were forced into desperate measures in order to survive or remain true to your honour. Regardless, you hold no illusions about what others are capable of in extremis and have learned the hard way that sometimes a bolt shell is worth a Lord Commander's ransom and that a starving man cannot eat gold, no matter how much he has grasped.</p><p>You understand that survival is the first law, and all else is luxury. Your experiences have hardened you, but also taught you the true value of preparation and pragmatism.</p>"
