Perhaps you were a visionary in search of strange knowledge, seeking answers to questions those around you never thought to ask, answers that proved dark indeed.</p><p>Or perhaps you denied the sanctity of the God-Emperor's church in your heart and fled its shackles of faith, or fought as part of a bloody revolt against the tyranny and injustice of your home world. In any case, you saw your only options to be escape or death. Now, the stars beyond await you with the possibility of freedoms and powers unguessed at and perils unknown.</p>"
