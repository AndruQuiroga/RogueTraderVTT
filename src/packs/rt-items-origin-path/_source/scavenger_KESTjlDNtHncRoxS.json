Yours was a hard life lived upon a knife-edge: the dark abyss of starvation on one side and death or worse on the other.</p><p>A childhood where each day of survival was a triumph has hardened and honed you, but left its scars on your soul. You have learned to blend into the background, to avoid notice, and to endure through sheer force of will.</p>"
