Whether it is something that has always been a part of you or was born in you from amidst a battlefield or came to you in a revelation, where others merely believe, you have certainty.\"</em></p></blockquote><p>It is this faith that has led you on a pilgrim's path to the stars, where you will bring the God-Emperor's will to the unbeliever and the needy, to protect the righteous and punish the enemies of mankind.</p><p>Your conviction burns with a fierce intensity that can inspire allies and terrify foes. You have seen the light of the Emperor's truth, and you will not rest until all the galaxy basks in His glory—or is cleansed by righteous fire.</p>"
