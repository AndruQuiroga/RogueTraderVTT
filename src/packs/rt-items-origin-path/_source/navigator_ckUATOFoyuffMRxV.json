They are members of ancient Navigator Houses who jealously guard their bloodlines, for their unique mutation is both their greatest blessing and their darkest curse. Without Navigators, humanity's galactic empire would crumble, as interstellar travel would take centuries instead of weeks.</p><h3>Starting Skills</h3><p>Common Lore (Navis Nobilite) (Int), Forbidden Lore (Navigators, Warp) (Int), Literacy (Int), Navigation (Stellar, Warp) (Int), Psyniscience (Per), Scholastic Lore (Astromancy) (Int), Speak Language (High Gothic, Low Gothic) (Int)</p><h3>Starting Talents</h3><p>Navigator, Pistol Weapon Training (Universal), Warp Eye</p><h3>Starting Gear</h3><p>Best-craftsmanship hellpistol or good-craftsmanship hand cannon, best-craftsmanship metal staff, best-craftsmanship xeno-mesh armour, Emperor's tarot deck, silk headscarf, Nobilite robes, charm, micro-bead.</p><h3>Special Abilities</h3><p><strong>Warp Eye:</strong> All Navigators begin with the Lidless Stare Navigator power as detailed in Chapter VII: Navigator Powers and may either select one additional power or improve an existing power.
