A good scapegrace knows that the law only applies to those caught by the enforcers, that a life is worth only as much as is spent on keeping it.</p><p>You've carried these hard earned lessons on into later life. Survival is best thought of as a game, with pleasure and ease the rewards along the way. A body must eat, drink, and live well, for death can come calling when it pleases.</p>"
