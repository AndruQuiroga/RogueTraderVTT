It has surrounded you your whole life, and you've had a weapon in easy reach ever since you were strong enough to grip one.\"</em></p></blockquote><p>You could have joined the PDF or even become a Guardsman, but what sort of life is that? Joining a regiment means orders here, orders there, and none that make any sense. It was clear to you that fighting for Thrones as a mercenary was the best way for a warrior to become rich in his trade and still escape with his skin.</p><p>You've seen death, victory, and most of the ugly things that lie in-between, but as long as there is always a fat purse waiting on the far side of the battlefield that's fine with you. As for the dead, the Emperor will know his own.</p>"
