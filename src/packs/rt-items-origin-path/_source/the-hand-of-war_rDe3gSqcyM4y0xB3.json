Not all wars, however, are equal, and you were caught up in a bitter and terrifying campaign in which starships were left as burning hulks and cities were blasted to ruin in a vicious series of battles that saw no quarter asked or given.\"</em></p></blockquote><p>The war and the enemy you fought to the death has had a profound effect on you, and to the present day, the faces of the dead haunt you still when you close your eyes. Now, you count only those you have fought and bled with as true allies, and will never forgive your old foe. You strive hard for what you desire, for you know that death stands never more than a heartbeat away.</p><p>The bonds forged in the crucible of war are stronger than any other, and your hatred for your sworn enemy burns with an undying flame.</p>"
