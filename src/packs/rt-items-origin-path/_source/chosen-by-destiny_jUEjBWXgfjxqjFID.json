The God-Emperor must watch over you, for sometimes events have unfolded in exactly the manner to carry your plans forward, and at others the options needed to set you upon the way ahead were suddenly placed before you.\"</em></p></blockquote><p>Perhaps you quest for forbidden truths that lie concealed in the darkest secrets of the Imperium, or perhaps you know in your heart that your fate lies upon strange xenos worlds, or perhaps you are sure that you will be the greatest of your bloodline, whose name will echo down through the ages, no matter what the cost.</p><p>This certainty of your own importance drives you ever forward, even as it may lead you down paths others fear to tread. You have seen signs and portents that convince you destiny has marked you for greatness—whether this is divine providence or dangerous delusion remains to be seen.</p>"
