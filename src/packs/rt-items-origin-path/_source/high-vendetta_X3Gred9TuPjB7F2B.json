Without your ship, your crewmates, and your allies, you are alone in the cold darkness of space and prey to enemies and rivals without number; with them, you are protected, you have a home and backup when others seek your life.\"</em></p></blockquote><p>This knowledge was brought home to you when you and your allies were caught up in a deadly vendetta with another faction, a murderous feud that consumed your life and sent friends to their graves. Whether your enemies were a rival crew, noble house, cult, cartel, or outlaw gang, blood was spilt and vengeance taken. Regardless of whether your side was victorious, or was left tasting bitter defeat in the end, what matters was that you fought and would do so again.</p><p>The vendetta has left you hardened, paranoid, and fiercely protective of those you consider allies. You have learned that in the void, loyalty is the only currency that truly matters.</p>"
