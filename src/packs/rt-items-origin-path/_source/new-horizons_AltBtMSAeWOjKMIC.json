Perhaps you seek forbidden knowledge hidden in ancient texts and ruins, willing to risk corruption for the chance to understand the universe's deepest secrets. Or you may have devoted yourself to studying the xenos\u2014their technology, their cultures, their history\u2014walking the dangerous line between academic inquiry and heresy. Some pursue the lost treasures of the Dark Age of Technology, seeking archeotech artifacts that could reshape the Imperium.</p><p>Your pursuit of new horizons has brought you both knowledge and peril. You have seen things that most Imperial citizens never dream of, learned truths that the Ecclesiarchy would condemn. Yet this knowledge comes at a price\u2014suspicion, corruption, or worse. Now you travel with a Rogue Trader, where the boundaries of acceptable inquiry stretch further than anywhere else in the Imperium.</p><h3>Advanced Origin Rules</h3><p>This origin path contains three powerful options, each with an associated Experience Point cost. Choose ONE option from those presented below and pay the listed XP cost from your starting experience. This choice must be made during character creation and cannot be changed later.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> If an option grants you training in a skill or talent you already possess, you may instead gain +10 to that skill OR reduce the XP cost by 50 (for duplicate talents).</p>"
