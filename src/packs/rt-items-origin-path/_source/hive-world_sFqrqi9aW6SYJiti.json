      "value": "<h2>Hive World</h2><blockquote><p><em>\"The great hives are not like the lesser cities of other worlds in the Imperium, and you are not like the common men and women who live there. Technology has surrounded you all your life, and you find its rarity elsewhere bemusing. You are an adventurer, an opportunist—more inquisitive than your fellows and certainly quicker on the draw!\"</em></p></blockquote><p>Hive worlds are home to countless teeming billions. The population is so dense that frequently great swathes of the surface of the world are covered with gargantuan cities stretching from horizon to horizon. Many hivers labour in thankless obscurity, manning huge manufactories that churn out endless streams of weapons, chemicals, or other vital goods. Others run with violent gangs in the dark of the underhives, living by their wits and savagery in an endless struggle for survival.</p><h3>Life on a Hive World</h3><p>Hive worlds are vital to the welfare of the Imperium and are the beating heart of its economy and war machine. They are industrial worlds, producing munitions for the Emperor's armies in vast manufactories, mining valuable minerals, and refining fuel for the Imperial fleet. Innumerable regiments of the Imperial Guard are raised from their massive populations.</p><p>Hive cities are astonishingly large—massive urban conglomerations set with spires of adamantine and rockcrete whose roots sink deep into the earth, and that can grow to cover continents and soar for kilometres into the sky. Each major hive houses billions of Imperial citizens and is a nation in its own right.</p><p>A shroud of pollution clings to the lower portions of many industrial hive cities, condemning a great many to shortened and slowly poisoned lives as they toil to feed the city's gargantuan manufactories. Only the wealthy can afford to live in the upper sections of such a hive, in gleaming spires that pierce the clouds below.</p>"
