You know that others may see the haunted look within your eyes, and that they guess at your motives when your back is turned, watching for that tell-tale twitch or grimace that surfaces when your fears come unbidden to the forefront of your mind.</p><h3>Advanced Origin Rules</h3><p>This origin path contains three powerful options, each with an associated Experience Point cost. Choose ONE option from those presented below and pay its XP cost from your starting experience. This choice must be made during character creation and cannot be changed later.</p>"

Whether voluntary or not, you have fled the Imperium to escape them, entering exile in the unknown darkness. Your time beyond civilisation may be one of preparation, steeling yourself for the day you must return, or you may simply believe that you can never truly go back.
