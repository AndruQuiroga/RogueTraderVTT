You suffer none to be so ignorant as to deride you as unworthy of your name, unfit for your legacy, or lacking in talent.\"</em></p></blockquote><p>When you seek to prove yourself, it is for the sake of your own high standards, or perhaps out of frustration that the mighty do not yet recognize your true worth. Regardless, it is for you to lead and demonstrate your worth by your actions and your bearing, and any that doubt or disparage you had best have the steel to back up their words.</p><p>Your pride is not mere vanity—it is the armor you wear against a galaxy that would grind you to dust. You will be respected, or you will be feared, but you will never be forgotten.</p>"
