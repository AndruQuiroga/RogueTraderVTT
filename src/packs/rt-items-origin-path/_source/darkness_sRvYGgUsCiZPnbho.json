Whatever the reason or circumstance, you bear forbidden knowledge. It might be part of the name of a daemon, or the location of some barbaric fane where human sacrifices are made in the name of the Ruinous Powers. It might also be something a bit more mundane, such as a proscribed experiment being conducted by a Magus-Biologis of the Adeptus Mechanicus. Whatever it is, you're sure that if the powers that be were to learn that you know, they would stop at nothing to purge it from you.",

Whatever the secret is, you're sure it will devastate you and your friends if found out. There are no lengths you would not go to prevent that discovery. Something terrible happened to you, but it gave you a great advantage as well. However, you also harbour a dark secret you struggle to be rid of. Work with the GM to determine what this is and what circumstances are required to remove it.
