To make matters worse, there are traps in the criminal underworld that will lead to far worse consequences than years of hard labour in an Imperial penal colony.\"</em></p></blockquote><p>You are an individual declared guilty by Imperial law or called outcast by the crime baron you once served and have no recourse but to leave the life you once knew. The black paths of smugglers and renegades that winds behind the facade of Imperial society offer a dangerous refuge for those one step ahead of justice, as well as those so damaged by past punishment that they could never rejoin a law-abiding citizenry.</p>"
