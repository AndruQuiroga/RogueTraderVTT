Because of this interaction, Frontier World characters are immune to Fear when caused by a xenos with a Fear (2) or Fear (1). If the Fear Test difficulty is 3 or higher, however, it affects the character as normal. Of course, this outlook often puts them at odds with members of the Ecclesiarchy and as such they suffer a −5 penalty to all Interaction Tests when dealing with members of the Imperial Cult.</p>"
