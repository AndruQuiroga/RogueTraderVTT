    "effect": "A Kroot may devour a fresh corpse that has been killed no more than 24 hours previously and that is from an organic creature (no daemons or machines). In so doing they gain a number of bonus wounds equal to the unmodified Toughness Bonus that the corpse possessed in life (default to 3 if unknown). These bonus wounds cannot exceed the Kroot's own Toughness Bonus, and remain for a number of hours equal to the Kroot's Toughness Bonus or until lost. These wounds are lost first if damage is taken. For the same amount of time, if a Kroot has consumed a Corpse, they will heal at twice the normal rate and add one bonus wound to any form of healing they receive. Eating a new corpse replaces the bonus of the previous one.",
