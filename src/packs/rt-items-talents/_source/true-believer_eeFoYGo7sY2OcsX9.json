If fail, roll on shock table.\nThe Dictates are: Red is the Colour of Redemption. Do not consume Narcotics, alcohol, or other substances of pleasure. Do not suffer the witch to live, cast them into fire. Do not suffer the mutant to live, rend their flesh apart. Do not suffer the heretic, force them to penance and then death. Should you be required to appear as others, then do so, but don the mask of redemption should a sinner need ending. When taking up weapons, do not show your face, for you are a tool of The Emperor. Pain is a Gift, mortification should be performed daily.",
