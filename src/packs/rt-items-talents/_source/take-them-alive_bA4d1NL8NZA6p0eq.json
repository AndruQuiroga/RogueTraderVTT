Additionally, Attacks the character makes with Shocking Weapons gain no bonuses to resist from armour, and all attacks with Snare weapons suffer an additional -10 to avoid or escape the snaring effect.\nNote: Later versions of the game don't have armour affect shocking test. So instead, let's say this talent applies an additional -10 to resist Shocking Weapons.</p>",
