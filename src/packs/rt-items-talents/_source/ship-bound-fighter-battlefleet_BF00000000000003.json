      "value": "<p><strong>Ship-Bound Fighter:</strong> Living and training on a spacecraft is vastly different than living and training on the ground. Because of the close-in nature of ships, Battlefleet characters are unaccustomed to fighting in open spaces or on the \"dirtside\" of planets. While they are on a planet they suffer a −2 penalty to Initiative Tests and double the Ballistic Skill penalty for firing weapons at Long Range or greater. These penalties don't apply to the character if they are inside a tunnel or other confined space.</p>"
