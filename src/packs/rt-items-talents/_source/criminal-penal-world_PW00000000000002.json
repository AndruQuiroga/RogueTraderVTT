Conversely, they suffer a −20 penalty on Interaction Tests when dealing with the following organisations: Adeptus Arbites, Ecclesiarchy, Enforcers, and the Military should his home world become known (at the GM's discretion). Also, should this status ever become known, the Explorer may find themselves under the scrutiny of local law enforcement and underworld crime bosses.</p>"
