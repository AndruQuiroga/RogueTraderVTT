Each additional attack counts as a Free Action and cannot be combined with any other talents or abilities that would grant further extra attacks (such as Lightning Attack, Furious Assault, etc). The Character can choose the order in which they attack their opponents. Against hordes, their attacks deal additional damage to the Horde's Magnitude equal to half their Weapon Skill Bonus.</p>",
