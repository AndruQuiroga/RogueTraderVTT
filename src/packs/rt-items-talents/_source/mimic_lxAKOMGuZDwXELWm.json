Listeners must make a -10 Scrutiny Test to tell the difference, or +0 Test if the character only mainly used Vox Recordings or Comm-Link Conversations to learn how to mimic the voice. Character's Deception automatically fails if the listeners can see them and identify they are not who they sound like. In a Social Conflict, if the character mimics their foe in order to ridicule or disparage them, the foe loses 1d10 rather than 1d5 Willpower if the character wins the opposed test.</p>",
