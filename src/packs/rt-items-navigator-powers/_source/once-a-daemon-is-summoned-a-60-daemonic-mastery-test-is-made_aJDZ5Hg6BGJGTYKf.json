If succeeded the Daemon is bound, if failed the Daemonhost is unbound, if failed by 3+ DoF, the Daemon is not bound at all and can do as it pleases, usually attacking immediately. Unbound Daemonhosts are in the host but uncontrolled, there is a very small chance they may not attack and be willing to negotiate regardless of the failiure, it is inadvisable to trust such things.",
