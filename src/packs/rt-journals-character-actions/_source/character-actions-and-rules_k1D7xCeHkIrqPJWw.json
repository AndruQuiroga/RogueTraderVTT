The GM could also roll once at the start of a session where the characters are involved in an endeavour to see what consequences occur. Misfortune can lead to potential profit factor loss or worse.\t\tAcquisition (Rogue Trader/Black Crusade)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCombat Actions (OW)\t\t\tEach Character can make one Full Action/two Half Actions on their turn, and one Reaction per Round (which can only be made when it isn't their turn),, as well as any reasonable number of Free Actions.\nSubtypes determine the circumstances actions can be taken in. A Character can only take One Attack Action and/or One Concentration Action on their Turn, they cannot take Movement Actions if immobilised.\nIf a Concentration Action extends over multiple turns, peforming a reaction may cancel the concentration action.\t\tBonuses and Penalties\t\tEffects on a test to make it easier or harder. Test Difficulty generally maxes out at +60/-60. More success or failiure on a test results in \"Degrees of Success\" or \"Degrees of Failiure\", which may make success or failiure more significant. +/-'s stack unless from same source.\nGenerally the greatest summed bonus one can gain is +/- 60.\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCarrying, Lifting, and Pushing Weights\t\t\t\t`\tCrit Effects, Energy (OW)\n\tRoll\tProfit Factor at Risk\tResult\t\tAcquisition is the process of the finding and purchasing of anything and everything a Rogue Trader may need. It consists of first locating the acquisition in question, then attempting to acquire it through levying Profit Factor. The Availability of the target acquisiton affects how difficult and time consuming the process is, or if it is even possible at all, the GM may need to make up an Availability if there isn't one appropriate.. Acquisitions cover anything from tools to weapons to starships to services to people, if something is needed, an acquisition may need to be made. Not everything can be acquired everywhere, an Archeotech Nova Cannon is unlikely to be acquired on a primitive world, the official blessing of a Cardinal may be easier to find on an Imperial World. This is especially true for items related to the Ruinous Powers or Xenos, asking about these in the wrong places could have lethal consequences.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tName\tDuration\tSubtype\tDescription\t\tStatus Effects and Conditions\t\tEnvironmental Effects\t\tRange \n(only relevent for ranged attacks)\t\tSize\n(Only Relevent for ranged attacks)\t\t\tSB+TB\tMax Carry Weight (kg)\tMax Lift Weight (kg)\tMax Push Weight (kg)\t\tCritical Damage\tEffect\n\t01-49\tNone\tNo Misfortune, Fate is kind to the Characters\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAim\tHalf/Full\tConcentration\tAs Half Action, add +10 to next Attack Test.

Can only evade attacks character is aware of. For AoE Attacks, dodges also move up to Agility Bonus metres, if still in area, dodge then fails. For Attacks with multiple hits, successful evasion avoid one hit per Degree of Success (or two for Storm weps).

Their chest and abdomen flesh cooked.\n\t41-45\tDistracted Tech-Priests\tAn Arch-Magos has called all Tech-Priests including many within the Rogue Trader's employ to attend a gathering. The Machine Cult cares little for their trivial responsibilities in the face of such an event.\t\tThe Acquisition Test\t\t\tOnce the Acquisition has been located, an Acquisition Test is made to acquire it. This Test is made vs the Group's Profit Factor. Success on Test acquires the item, failiure does not. Availability, Scale, Craftsmanship, and other environmental factors may affect Test difficulty.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKnock-Down\tHalf\tAttack, Melee\tCharacter makes Opposed Strength Test vs target in melee range. If winning, target is knocked prone. If 2+ Degrees of Success, can inflict 1d5-3 + SB damage, and 1 Fatigue. If failing by 2+ DoF, character is knocked down instead. \nGain +10 to test if used a Half Action to move on same turn.\t\tEnvironmental Effects\tDarkness: WS Tests in darkness have -20, BS Tests have -30, Concealment Tests have +20.

Energy Ripples across their body with horrific third-degree burns.\n\t46-50\tLocal Economic Downturn\tThe Sub-Sector's Trade dries up and markets enter a low point. Merchant houses cut short their Endeavours and many holdings lose value.\t\tAvailability\tUbiquitous\tAbundant\tPlentiful\tCommon\tAverage\tScarce\tRare\tVery Rare\tExtremely Rare\tNear Unique\tUnique\t\tLightning Attack\tHalf\tAttack, Melee\tRequires Lightning Attack Talent. Weapon can't be Unbalacned or Unwieldy. Make -10 Weapon Skill Test, if successful hit once per Degree of Success up to Weapon Skill Bonus. Hits can be allocated to original target or anyone in melee that wouldn't have been harder to hit. If Character is dual wielding and has Two-Weapon Wielder Talent, can make two Half Action duration attacks with -20 (don't have to be same type) as part of this action.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t16\t675\t1350\t2700\t\t5\tCharacter is knocked prone and must make +0 Agility Test or catch on Fire. They must also make a +0 Toughness Test or be Stunned for 1 Round. They are forced to the ground, keeling over in burning agony.\n\t51-55\tChanges to the Law\tA New Dicate of Mercantile law sees great upheaval amongst many guilds and merchants, with some even going under. Many previous lines of Commerce and Legal Compacts are now worthless as a result.\t\tModifier\t+70\t+50\t+30\t+20\t+10\t+0\t-10\t-20\t-30\t-50\t-70\t\tManoeuvre\tHalf\tMelee, Movement\tCharacter makes Opposed Weapon Skill Test vs target in melee range. If successful, target is forcibly moved by character 1 metre in desired direction. Character can then immediately advance 1 metre as well. Can't force target into another character or an obstacle such as a wall. Can push them off ledges.\t\tSize\tLarger targets are easier to hit, and harder to stay hidden and vice versa for smaller targets. As seen in table, targets of relevent size gain +/- to be hit and equal but opposite -/+ to concealment tests. It also affects Movement by (Size) - 4 (EG: Hulking adds +1 to Base Movement, Scrawny -1).\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t17\t900\t1800\t3600\t\t6\tCharacter is knocked prone and must make +0 Agility test or catch on Fire, they also suffer 1d5 Fatigue and are Stunned for 1d10 Rounds. The character is sent reeling to the ground with a smoking impact crater that quickly lights up.\n\t56-60\tResurgent Piracy\tPirates suddenly strike at the Rogue Trader's Interests, raiding worlds and assault vessels.\t\tScale/Crafts.\tNegligable\n(Single)\tTrivial\n(3-5)\tMinor\n(10-30)\tStandard\n(50-100)\tMajor\n(500-1000)\tSignificant\n(2000-5000)\tVast\n(10,000+)\tPoor\tCommon\tGood\tBest\t\tMove\tHalf/Full\tMovement\tAs a Half Action, make a Half Move (usually 1m x Agility Bonus). As a Full Action, make a Full Move (usually 2m x Agility Bonus). If ending movement next to an opponent, can engage in melee, \nIf moving away from an opponent in melee, they get a free Standard Attack action vs character.\t\tProviding Assistance\tA Character may assist in another's test, reducing its difficulty by one step (providing +10). Up to two may provide assistance. Requires assister to have training in any relevent skills, must be next to the one they are giving assistance to, and cannot help with reactions, free actions, tests to resist poisons/disease/fear or anything else GM deems innappropriate.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t18\t1350\t2700\t5400\t\t7\tCharacter is stunned for 2d10 Rounds and the suffer 1d10 Permenant Toughness Damage.

If condition is met before start of character's next turn, shooting action performed. Targets caught in arc make +0 Pinning Test or are pinned. Performing non-Free Actions before Overwatch activates ends its effect. If attack happens at same time as another character's action, higher agility bonus goes first, or both make opposed Agility Test.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t19\t1800\t3600\t7200\t\t8\tCharacter is stunned for 2d10 Rounds, their Strength, Toughness, and Agility are nonpermenantly halved until receiving medical treatment, they suffer 2d5 Permenant Fellowship Damage. The character's entire body is blackened as skin peels and fat melts.\n\t66-70\tLoss of Respect\tGreat Leaders within local Imperial Organisations suddenly display less respect for the Rogue Trader. Their opinion will likely spread from the top down and into broader knowledge if not stopped.\t\tStarship Acquisition\t\t\tThe Massive scale of starships and their components require different acquisition tests. Starship components are not affected by scale, (but does still consider Availability and Craftsmanship). Scale is replaced by Component Type. If type is not obvious, default to Structure Type.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tReady\tHalf\tMiscellaneous\tCharacter draws a weapon, retrieves an object, or properly stores an object (although dropping a free action). Also used to apply/use a tool such as a Medi-patch, injecting a drug, coating a blade in poison, or so on. \nReady can be done twice in a turn if each ready targets a different weapon or item (such as readying two pistols).\t\tCover\tCover provides additional AP to the body and legs (can vary with cover and actions), if shot pierces cover's AP, its AP is reduced by 1. Cover doesn't by itself lower BS Tests to hit those behind it. \nExample Cover AP's: Thin metal/Armour-glas (4), Flakboard/sandbags (8), Cogitator Banks (12), Rockcrete, thick iron, stone (16), Bulkheads, Plasteel, Armaplas (32).\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t20\t2250\t4500\t9000\t\t9\tThe Character is set ablaze in a superheated inferno, their skin melts, eyes pop, and they fall to the ground a screaming, blackened corpse.\n\t71-75\tFaith Questioned\tSome claim the Rogue Trader is adherent to an unseemly Imperial Cult located in Footfall, making them appear uncivilised amongst much of Imperial Society within the more well developed regions.\t\tComp. Type\tWar\tEtheric\tPower\tStructure\tAcquiring a Starship meanwhile is not affected by Craftsmanship, Availability, or any kind of Scale, Instead the only base modifier to the Acquisition Test is a negative modifier based on the ship's Hull Points (EG: 25 Hull Points = -25 on Acquisition Test. Starships are far more likely to be Acquired as opposed to being built, which takes decades and requires ludicrous resources. The Largest vessels may have modifiers of -90 or more, likely requiring several favours, dealings, and concessions made to even have a hope of acquiring one.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tReload\tVaries\tMiscellaneous\tReloads a ranged weapon, time is listed in weapon's stats. Reloads that take longer than a Full Action are an Extended Action, that requires multiple continuous Full Actions to complete.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t21 (HB Est.)\t3150\t6300\t12600\t\t10+\tThe Character is set ablaze in a superheated inferno, dying horribly.

Many sycophants have followed in their stead, with likely more doing so over time unless an intervention is made.\t\tModifier\t-30\t-20\t-10\t+0\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRun\tFull\tMovement\tCharacter moves a distance equal to their Run movement (usually 6m x Agility Bonus). Ranged attacks targeting them have -20, whilst Melee attacks targeting them have +20.\nIf moving away from an opponent in melee, they get a free Standard Attack action vs character.\t\tPinning\tWhen targeted by Suppressive Fire, even if shots hit cover or character takes no damage. Must make -20 Pinning (Willpower) Test. On success, may act normally, otherwise they are Pinned and  can only take Half Actions, suffer -20 to BS Tests, and cannot leave cover except to retreat while remaining in cover. If not in cover must use next turn to reach cover or move away from attacker if not possible. Can make Willpower Test to end pinning effect at end of turn, which is +30 if not under fire.

They will be looked down on for such unruly workers, if the Rebellion is real they may have greater problems.\t\tAffecting Acquisition Tests\t\t\tThere are several ways to alter the difficulty of an Acquisition Test. Such as through diplomacy, location, etc. This may help or Hinder the Characters depending on whether they or their opponents are using such things. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStand/Mount\tHalf\tMovement\tIf character is currently on the ground/prone, they stand up if they are capable of doing so. If they are standing, they can mount/dismount something, like a riding beast or vehicle. \t\tShooting into Melee\tShooting a Ranged or Thrown weapon against a target character is in Melee range of that is not Stunned, Helpless, or Unaware has -20 or +0 for a Pistol, with no benefits from being at such close ranges.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t24 (HB Est.)\t6750\t13500\t27000\t\t2\tHit arm is useless for 1d5 Rounds, character suffers 1 Fatigue. The arm spasms with crackling Energy\n\t91-95\tOpen Rivalry\tA Rival of the Rogue Trader can suffer them no longer. Lesser figures avoid both sides while such emnity is present, whilst the rival strikes openly at the Rogue Trader's interests.\t\tCommon Items\tAssuming the characters are not in a desperate situation and have access to their usual resources, Acquisition of Average Availability, Common Craftsmanship items (or easier to acquire) on a personal, character scale should not require Acquisition Tests. Such as for Flak Armour, Combat Knives, Ration Packs, etc. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStandard Attack\tHalf\tAttack, Melee/Ranged\tCharacter makes one melee or ranged attack as +10 Weapon Skill or +10 Ballistic Skill Test.

Anyone that finds out will avoid the Rogue Trader with good reason.\t\tUnique Items\tUnique and Near Unique Availability items do not exist in sufficient quantities to benefit from scale, and so gain no bonuses from Scale (can't be better than +0).\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStun\tFull\tAttack, Melee\tCharacter who is unarmed or using a melee weapon can attempt to stun target rather than kill them, making -20 Weapon Skill Test. If successful roll 1d10+Strength Bonus, Target rolls 1d10 + Toughness Bonus + Head Armour Points.\nIf character's roll was higher, target is stunned for a number of turns equal to the difference between the two rolls and gains 1 Fatigue.\t\tDual Wielding\tIf the Character possesses the Two-Weapon Wielder (Melee or Ranged) Talent, they can make an attack action with each of the two melee or ranged weapons as part of one attack action (or one melee and one ranged if possessing both talents). These Attacks have -20.\nThis attack can be any Half-Action length Attack Action, and can be different for the two attacks, E.G, one Full-Auto Burst and one Standard Attack, one attack made with each weapon.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t26 (HB Est.)\t10350\t20700\t41400\t\t4\tHit arm is usless for 1d10 Rounds, character is Stunned for 1 Round. The shock of the painful impact causes temporary loss of autonomous functions.\n\t\t\t\t\tContinued Supply\tAcquiring Consumables/Drugs/Ammo also acquires a steady supply of it, that can be replenished when returning to the vessel or suitable safe restocking area, similarly, acquiring a weapon also acquires a steady supply of the basic ammo type it uses.

Targets within kill zone regardless of whether BS Test succeeds or not make -10 Pinning Test if Semi-Auto or -20 if Full Auto, and Pinned if they Fail. If BS Test was passed, hit once, +1 per two Degrees of Success, hits are assigned to random target in kill zone. Can't choose to fail BS Test.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t27 (HB Est.)\t12150\t24300\t48600\t\t5\tCharacter is Stunned for 1 Round, the hit arm is rendered useless until receiving medical treatment (treat as only having 1 arm).\n\tUnwanted Attention\t\tExcessive Spending or Annoying the wrong people can get characters into unexpected problems. Not all become apparent immediately, and may lead to further endeavours to recover stolen goods, discover fraud, etc.\t\tCombined Acquisitions\tOne Acquisition can have multiple related components, EG: laspistol + Red-dot sight.

Make +0 Weapon Skill Test, if successful hit once, +1 per two Degree of Success up to Weapon Skill Bonus. Hits can be allocated to original target or anyone in melee that wouldn't have been harder to hit. \nIf Character is dual wielding and has Two-Weapon Wielder Talent, can make two Half Action duration attacks with -20 (don't have to be same type) as part of this action.\t\t\tThe Ambidextrous Talent reduces the penalty for dual wielding by 10, from -20 to -10.\nBladedancer and Sure Strike reduce the penalty for dual wielding one-handed melee and pistol weapons by 10 respectively.\nThe Sidearm Talent reduces the penalty for dual wielding a one-handed melee and pistol weapon by 10\nAmbidextrous stacks with Bladedancer, Gunslinger, or Sidearm to remove the penalty entirely.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t28 (HB Est.)\t13950\t27900\t55800\t\t6\tCharacter suffers 1d5 Fatigue and 1d5 Nonpermenant Weapon and Ballistic Skill Damage, they must make a +0 Toughness Test or permenantly lose the use of the hit hand. The Character's arm is wreathed in flame, clothing and armour scorched and melted.\n\tRoll\tName\tResult\t\tIllegal Acquisitions\tCertain acquisitions such as Illegals, Xenotech, Archeotech, etc, may not be traditionally acquirable without deliberate searching, and may have consequences attached.

The heat of the attack boils the Character's bone marrow, shattering it internally with a grim snapping sound.\n\t01-10\tPickpocket\tA Pickpocket targets a character, they lose any one item they have on their person that could be reasonably stolen. The Character can make a Scrutiny Test to catch the thief.\t\tAcquisition Location\tGenerally, Acquisitions should occur at appropriate locations, such as merchant districts, ports, etc, acting as downtime. Additionally, not everything can be acquired anywhere, Power Armour be only be acquirable at a Forge World. Furthermore a tech-priest wouldn't care for fine wines, but would like a massive shipment of radioactives.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUse a Skill\tVaries\tConcentration, Miscellaneous\tCharacter makes use of a skill, possibly making a skill test. This may be an Extended Action.\t\tStray Shots\tShots that miss the intended target, such from a failed BS Test or when firing on Semi/Full Auto can scatter 1d5 metres, meaning they may yet hit other closeby targets be they ally or enemy. For balance, those other targets must as easy or easier to hit than the original target.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t30 (HB Est.)\t17550\t35100\t70200\t\t8\tCharacter's Arm is destroyed, they suffer 1d10 Fatigue and must make +0 Toughness Test or be Stunned for  1d5 Rounds.

They may be a single individual, or a representative of a larger organisation.\t\tAcquisition by any means\tA Player may permenantly burn 1 Profit Factor to add +10 to their Acquisition Test. This can be explained as the extreme usage of favours, mass liquidation of assets, and so on.

They are reasonably well armed as to offer at least some challenge to fight.\t\tUnscrupulous Traders\tMerchants may not neccisarily give fair prices, or know what the true value of what they are selling is. A GM may secretly modify the Acquisition test by up to -30/+30 to represent this. A Character may use the Evaluate Skill to try to gauge the real Value and Acquisition Modifier.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWeapon Attacks\tMake Weapon Skill (Melee) or Ballistic Skill (Thrown/Pistol/Basic/Heavy) Test taking into account any bonuses or penalties to roll (Range, Target Size, Environmental Effect, Conditionals). If roll result is less than WS/BS Characteristic, succeeed at test.\nFor each full 10 the roll is less than characterstic, gain 1 Degree of Success. Similarly, for each full 10 more, gain 1 Degree of Failiure. If Semi/Full Auto, Degrees of Success fire more shots up to Weapon Rate of Fire.\nIf successful, invert roll to determine hit location (EG: Roll of 31 results in 13 for hit location). Hit Locations: 1-10: Head, 11-20: Right Arm, 21-30: Left Arm, 31-70: Body, 71-85: Right Leg, 86-00: Left Leg\nRoll Damage die, sum to find total damage.

Suffer -10 to Acquisition Tests when using Profit Factor from this location.\t\tCommerce\tThe Character or an opposing NPC may initiate an Opposed Commerce Test vs Opponent's Commerce or Scrutiny to try to improve prices in their favour. Success temporarily increases Profit Factor by 2, +2 per Degree of Success, for the purposes of making the Acquisition Test. Losing the Opposed Test however temporarily decreases character's Profit Factor by 2, +2 per Degree of Failiure, for purposes of Acquisition Test. In rare instances, Command, Charm, or Barter may replace Commerce for specific individuals or organisations being traded with. The Test may be easier or harder depending on how well known the Rogue Trader is and what the oppoisition's Opinion of them is.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDeafened\tAutomatically Fail any test any Test that relies on Hearing.

Make another weapon or Ballistic Skill Test with the same modifiers as the original one, if this suceeds Righteous Fury is confirmed and the attacker adds an extra d10 to the damage roll, this can happen multiple times. Bonus damage dice, such as those added via the Accurate Weapon quality, do not trigger Righteous Fury.\nOnly War/Black Crusade: Whenever a Damage die of a weapon attack rolls a natural 10, and opponent is harmed by the attack, roll 1d5 as a Critical Hit (doesn't count as them being critically hit for damage state purposes).

If the GM believes that the character's current endeavour may have wide consequences, they may simualte this as a Misfortune. The GM could also roll once at the start of a session where the characters are involved in an endeavour. \nMisfortune can lead to profit factor being put at risk. If the misfortune is ignored, the Profit Factor is permenantly lost, if it is resolved it can be saved and restored.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStunned\tStunned Characters cannot take actions, and attacks vs Stunned Targets have +20.

Infamy is the scale of how much a character is feared, and how well they can exert that fear to get others to do what the want. Infamy can be used for Acquisition similarly to Profit Factor, but with slightly different values.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWeapon Types\tMelee weapons are used in melee (although some may have a range, such as whips), if it is two-handed, may wield one handed with -20 penalty. Add Strength Bonus to damage. Thrown Weapons have a range based on Strength Bonus, add Strength Bonus to damage (except grenades).\nPistols are usually one handed and can be used in melee (but gain no bonuses to hit due to point-blank range). Basic Weapons are usually two-handed, but can be one handed at -20 penalty. Heavy Weapons must be two-handed, if not braced -30 penalty and can't semi/full auto.\t\t\t\t\tUnaware\tAttacking a target that doesn't know you're there or who cannot react in time has +30 to the attacking test. Unaware characters are no longer so after having been attacked, whether the attack hit or not. Surprised Targets are Unaware.\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTrivial\t-60\n\t\tBest\tThe most ancient and superlative of Imperial Technology, breathtaking artistry, a master of their work, a group of nigh-unbreakable loyalty, the greatest warriors of an entire world, that fit for great nobles and individuals of most significance.\t\tAvailability\tUbiquitous\tAbundant\tPlentiful\tCommon\tAverage\tScarce\tRare\tVery Rare\tExtremely Rare\tNear Unique\tUnique\t\tFate Points\tFate Points allow a player to alter the Fate of their character. Spent Fate Points are regained next session, burnt Fate Points reduce total Fate Points permenantly. Fate points can be spent to do one of the following:\n1. Re-roll a failed test once, the re-rolled result is final.            2. Add an extra degree of success to a test after the dice is rolled                                3. Heal 1d5 Damage (doesn't affect Critical Damage)\n4. Gain +10 to a test prior to it being rolled.                               5. Count as having rolled a 10 for initiative                                                                     6. Instantly recover from being Stunned.  \nFate Points can be Permenantly Burnt to avoid death or some other horrible effect that cannot be resolved by merely spending a Fate Point. Although this does not mean they escape harm. Fate Points can be burnt even if already spent. If the group as a whole are about to die, each burns a fate point seperately to live. Generally, characters should not be put in situations where they must continually burn fate points to keep living. One should be enough to be safe for a session.\nFate Points can be awarded by the GM for performing exceptional actions, reaching certain milestones, or whatever else the GM deems appropriate. It's entirely up to them though.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tUnconcious\tUnconciousness is usually temporary, characters are unaware of surroundings and cannot take actions. They are Helpless. If no duration given for unconciousness, assume 10-TB Minutes.\t\t\t\t\t\t\tElementary\t-50\t\tHallucinogenic Effects\n\t\tUbiquitous\tLowest value goods and services, things of little worth that are easily available to basically anyone, the most primitive of technology or most trivial information and gossip.\t\tModifier\t+70\t+50\t+30\t+20\t+10\t+0\t-10\t-20\t-30\t-50\t-70\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVacuum (Slow)\tIf trapped in slowly worsening atmosphere, can survive unharmed for 2xTB Rounds.

Characters have a number of Infamy Points equal to their Infamy Bonus (10's category of their Infamy Bonus). The Abilities of Infamy Points improve the more Corruption the character has, note this still allows access to those earlier effects. If using Infamy Points for Non-Heretics, replace Corruption with something else.\n0-20 Corruption,     Spend to do one of: Remove all Fatigue, Heal 1d5 Wounds and any Critical Damage (but not Effects of Critical Hits), Add +10 to a single test prior to rolling.\n21-60 Corruption,   Spend to do one of: Heal 1d5+1 Wounds and any Critical Damage (but not Effects of Critical Hits), Reroll any failed Characteristic Test (must use new roll), Add one Degree of Success on a successful Test.\n61-100 Corruption, Spend to do one of: Heal 1d10 Wounds and any Critical Damage (but not Effects of Critical Hits), Count as having rolled a 10 for initiative, Immediately recover from being stunned.\nRather than Burning Infamy Points, If a Character would die, they instead lose 10+1d10 Infamy, becoming incapacitated for the rest of the session (but not being able to be killed for the rest of the session). They can instead lose 8+1d10 Infamy to return to 1 Wound, however can still die again if they take too much more damage. In either situation if a Heretic they gain 1d10 Corruption (or something else if not, such as Insanity). If the character does not have enough Infamy, they instead simply die. The Loss of Infamy reduces Infamy Points, unspent first.\nThose that dedicate themselves to the Dark Gods find their Infamy Effects Altered.\nNurgle: When using Infamy Points to Regain Wounds, always gain the maximum amount. However, cannot spent Infamy Points to reroll failed Characteristic Tests.\nKhorne: At Tier 2 (21+ Corruption), Prior to Rolling, can spend 1 Infamy Point to instantly succeed on a WS or BS Test with 1 Degree of Success. However, When Spending Infamy Points to regain Wounds, reduce it by 2 (min 1)\nTzeentch: At Tier 1 (0+ Corruption), can spend Infamy Points to add one DoS to a successful Test. At Tier 2 (21+ Corruption) can instead add 1d5 DoS to a successful test. However cannot spend Infamy Points to gain +10 to Characteristic Tests.\nSlaanesh: At Tier 2 (21+ Corruption), when suffering a Critical Hit, can immediately spend a Fate Point to ignore any effects it causes except for Limb/Appendage Loss, Death, and being Stunned. However Cannot spend Infamy Points to recover from Stuns.\t\t\t\tDamage States\tLightly Damaged\tCharacters are Lightly Damaged if they have taken Damage equal to or less than twice their Toughness Bonus. They remove 1 Damage per day through natural healing. If devoting an entire day to rest, they remove TB Damage.\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRoutine\t-20\t\t2\t\tMy Hands…!\tThe Character is Stunned and drops anything they are holding, unable to pick them up until recovering. They believe their hands have transformed, fallen off, or degraded to nothing.\n\t\tCommon\tLow-end commodities, services of small or weak organisations such as bulk corpse-starch, contracts to convey pilgrims across holy paths, bribes to a local enforcer squad.\t\tMight Makes Right\t\tInfamy is often the go-to resources for those living outside the boundaries and restrictions of the Imperium, especially those dedicated to the ruinous powers. Within the order of the Imperium, such as on Imperial Worlds, such bullying may not be as effective. Acquisition Tests using Infamy have -10 on Imperial Worlds and other places of strict order.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHeavily Damaged\tCharacters are Heavily Damaged if they have taken more than twice their Toughness Bonus in damage. They remove 1 Damage per week from natural healing, and if devoting an entire week to rest, heal TB Damage. Once damage is less than 2xTB, they are Lightly Damaged.\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOrdinary\t-10\t\t3\t\tThey're coming from the walls!\tThe Character fires at a random piece of terrain within their line of sight (determine direction using scatter diagram, with a 7 being upwards, and 0 being downwards). Believing monsters coming out of the walls.\n\t\tAverage\tCommonly traded commodities, frequently used services, useful ores and raw materials, bulk labour and use of indentured servants for semi-skilled tasks.\t\tServices and Manipulation\t\tServices can be acquired as anything else can, however sometimes services can be forced without any acquisition needed. At GM discretion the character can make an Opposed Infamy Test vs those they want the service from, if successful they can force the target to do their bidding, at least for the time being. This is likely to have negative future consequences...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCritically Damaged\tCharacters are Critically Damaged if they have damage in excess of their Wounds. This does not heal without Medical Attention. With Rest and Medical Attention, heal 1 Critical Damage per week. When no Critical Damage left, become Heavily Damaged instead.\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChallenging\t0\t\t4\t\tNobody can see me!\tThe Character believes themselves invisible and uses their Full Action to wander in a random direction (determine direction using scatter diagram). They maintain their Reaction.\n\t\tScarce\tStandard but reasonably profitable resources/services such as promethium or refined plasteel, blessed machine fluids, a month's docking rights at an imperial outpost.\t\tThe Perils of Dependence\t\tIt is generally not intended to use Infamy to acquire things on behalf of another, however at GM Discretion one character may acquire an item for another character. This second character must however make their own Infamy Test with no modifiers, if they fail this test they lose 1 Infamy, seen as subservient and relying on the charity of others.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMedical Attention\tHealing Drugs, Psychic Powers, and Medicae Tests can accelerate healing. Medicae Skill is needed for First Aid and Extended Care.\nUse (Full Action): First Aid, Skill Test, For Lightly Wounded targets success heals damage equal to user's Intelligence Bonus, for Heavily/Critically damaged, heals 1 damage. Can't repeat if failed test. First Aid can be given once per 24 Hours to the same individual.\nUse: Extended Care, Treat Int Bonus Patients (-10/person beyond). Test/day Lightly damaged, Test/Week Heavily/Crit damaged. Success heals 2x First aid, +1 per DoS, remove Crit damage first. 2+ DoF does 1 damage, 4+ DoF 1d10 damage (Can kill with crit damage). \nUse: Diagnose: Skill Test diagnose disease of target/group, prevent crew loss from disease, etc on extended voyages.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDifficult\t10\t\t5\t\tI can Fly!\tThe Character believes they can fly, and uses their Full Action to jump up and down, or off of any nearby ledge.\n\t\tRare\tCommon but high end resources, favour of a moderately powerful Imperial Organisation, Imperial Guard-issue fabricated base-structures, the hiring of cogitating power of a minor wing of the Administrum.\t\tTrade\tIf words are not enough, backing them up with wealth can help get what you want. To Trade, acquisitions owned by the character are offered as bargaining to affect the Acquisition Modifier. If the Recipient is accepting of the offer, determine its Acquisition Modifier as if acquiring it, then flip the sign. EG: A Single Good Craftsmanship Hellpistol has an Acquisition Modifier of -10 (-10-10+10), granting +10 to the Infamy Acquisition Test if used as part of a Trade. If the item has a +0 Modifier, it provides +5 to the Infamy Acquisition Test. The Value of items may vary with location and recipient, a finely crafted sword would be valued highly on a feral world, but would be of little significance to a forge world. Items used for Trade are lost if the Acquisition is completed successfully.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHard\t20\t\t6\t\tThey've got it in for me…\tThe Character attempts to hide from both enemy and ally, moving to a position of cover where they are out of line of sight and remaining there until recovering.\n\t\tVery Rare\tDifficult to acquire objects and resources, short supplied/highly demanded services, arcane devices crafted by the mechanicus, a complete set of Genestealer bones.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVery Hard\t30\t\t7\t\tThey got me…\tThe Character believes themselves to be dying from whatever source the hallucingen cam from, collapsing \"Dead\".

There are, naturally, ways to game the system to get more than one is assigned, and punishments for being caught trying to do so. New Squads start at Logistics Rating 10, this can increase or decrease depending on the actions of the squad. The Munitorum Infouence Talent increases it by +5 per time per purchase.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRoll\tResult\t\t\t\tBasic Movement\t\t\t\t\t\tAmputated Limb\tA Character that loses a limb (that isn't the head, which is likely death) suffers Blood Loss.

In such conditions, a +0 Swim Skill Test would be made as a Full Action. Success swims up to Half Strength Bonus Metres, failiure means no movement. A Character can also go underwater, but must hold their breath. Characters unable to swim sink, and may suffocate. Swimming Whilst wearing heavy equipment such as armour imposes -30 to Swim Test and suffers 1 fatigue on failed Swim Test.\nFor Narrative Time, a character can swim for Toughness Bonus Hours, afterwards makes Toughness Test each hour with cumulative -10 Penalty, failiure causes 1 Fatigue.

Beyond this they are Encumbered.\nA Character's Lifting Weight is the amount they can pick up. Lifting a Heavy Load is a Full Action. Characters can go beyond this by making a +0 Strength Test, adding +1 per Degree of Success to Strength + Toughness Value. Failiure by 2+ Degrees suffers 1 Fatigue.\nA Character's Pushing Weight is the amount they can push over a smooth surface. Difficult terrain makes pushing harder. Pushing is a Full Action. As with Lifting they can make +0 Strength Test to add +1 per Degree of Success to Strength + Toughness Value. 2+ DoF causes 1 Fatigue.\nA Character can throw a non-thrown weapon object, making a +0 Strength Test (or -20 if more than 1/2 lifting weight, or Ballistic Test if thrown at specific target) causes object to fly Strength Bonus Metres * X, where X is 1+DoS. Failed Test object moves 1/2 Strength Bonus rounded down. Thrown Objects deal 1d10+Strength Bonus Impact Damage, +1 per Degree of Success on Test by default. (can be varied by GM if object is large)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t3\tCharacter suffers 1 Fatigue and is Stunned for 1 Round. The attack cooks the side of their head superficially.\n\tUsing Subtlety\t\tThe GM uses Subtlety as a test to enhance other tests. If making a test benefitting subtltey a successful subtlety test grants a +20 bonus to that test, or -20 if the test benefits overtness, and vice versa.\t\t\t\t+20 to Logistics Test if Item is part of Standard Kit of Any Regiment on the Front.\t\t\t\tViolent Impasse\t-10\t71-75\tA File Folder marked \"High Command Only\".

In all instances, Design blueprints and/or examples are required as a prerequisite.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t4\tCharacter suffers 2 Fatigue and is Blinded for 1d5 Rounds. They are left Hairless as their head is burned.\n\tUsing Subtlety to prevent Influence Change\t\tIf Influence stands to be gained or lost, such as due to a plan gone wrong (or right!), a high level of subtlety can reduce the change, as long as there is no easy way to connect back to the group, a successful Subtlety test reduces Influence Gained or Lost by 1 per 2 DoS, as nobody knows that it was the group that did the act.

Hoverers fly over terrain but cannot go higher than 2 metres from the ground, Flyers can ascend to any height. Both must devote a Movement Action to remain Flying (Half, Full, Charge, or Run are all appropriate). A Flyer may ascend to Low Altitude, which is beyond Melee attack range but still within most ranged attacks. Those shooting such flying characters have an additional -10 to Ballistic Skill Tests. A Flyer may also fly to High Altitude beyond convential ranged attacks, and can only be attacked by other flying creatures.\nIf a hovering creature stops flying, it simply lands unharmed. Low Altitude falls, and takes fall damage as if it fell 15 Metres (1d10+15 I), High Altitude Fall as if having fell 25 metres (1d10+25), or more at GM discretion.\t\t\t\t\tTime\tThing\tSuccesses\tThe Crafting Extended Test needs a total number of Degrees of Success for the item to be completed. This can require multiple skill tests, with each one taking the listed time. The tests can repeat until the Success requirements are met, or too much failiure occurs. Required Successes will vary with circumstance.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t6\tCharacter suffers 1d5 Fatigue, is blinded for 1d10 Hours, and Permenantly reduces Fellowship by 1d10. Their face is cooked, melting their facial features and damaging their eyes.\n\tChanging Subtlety\t\tPlayers should only know their current subtlety rating at the start of a mission, as it goes on it should be hidden. Generally events should affect subtelty by either 1d5 (minor) or 1d10 (major) with modifiers as decided by GM. If the players take efforts to monitor enemy communications, the populace, etc, they can get a rough idea of subtlety levels.\n[Increasing] Booking under false names might increase Subtlety only by 1d5-2, but using entirely fake identies with cover stories, disguises, and properly falsified documents might increase it by 1d10+1.\n[Decreasing] Excercising Inquisitorial Authority would reduce subtltety based on the trustworthiness and discretion of those revealed to, as well as the publicity of the event. Intimidation and open combat also reduce subtlety.\t\t\t\t+20\t+0\t-30\t-50\tDominant\t+20\t86-90\tA Case containing two suits of Storm Trooper Carapace Armour.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChem Use Crafting\nAny Drug/Poison with which character is familiar and has sample of.\t1d5 Hours\tNatural Drugs/Poisons\t4\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t7\tCharacter suffers 1d10 Fatigue, they are Permenantly Blinded and must roll 1d10, which is their new Fellowship Value (unless they already had less than 10).
