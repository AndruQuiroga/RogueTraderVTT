## Enhanced Flavor Text

All lineages now include extensive flavor text directly from Into the Storm:

The Witch-Born lineage includes sections on:
- **A Legacy Written in the Warp** - How psychic ability runs in bloodlines
- **The Black Ships** - The League of Blackships and their terrifying visits
- **Living with the Gift** - Growing up knowing dangers most never face
- **The Cost of Knowledge** - How this heritage shapes you

### Example: Perilous Choice Talent Excerpt

> "There are fewer sins greater than concealing a psychic gift from the authorities, and fewer still that are more dangerous. Yet, for reasons you keep to yourself, you have made the decision to do just that."

Each talent includes:
- Source flavor text blockquotes
- Expanded narrative explaining the choice
- Mechanical benefits clearly stated
- Implementation notes for GMs

## Implementation Notes

### Perilous Choice Special Cases

The Perilous Choice talent requires special runtime implementation:

```javascript
// Check for unsanctioned psyker flag
if (actor.items.some(i => i.flags?.rt?.isUnsanctionedPsyker)) {
  // Use Renegade Psyker table for Psychic Phenomena
  const psychicStrengthRow = "renegade"; // Instead of "sanctioned"
}

// Prevent Astropaths/Navigators from taking it
if (actor.system.career === "astropath" || actor.system.career === "navigator") {
  ui.notifications.warn("Astropaths and Navigators cannot take Perilous Choice");
  return false;
}
```

### Choice Dialogs Needed

Several talents require player choices during application:

| Talent | Choice Required |
|--------|----------------|
| My Great-Grandfather | Choose one Peer talent |
| Heir Apparent | Choose one career skill for Talented |
| Uncertain Inheritance | Choose +3 Int or +3 Per |
| Shameful Offspring | Choose Carouse or Gamble skill |
| Secret Taint | Choose +5 Int or +5 WP |
| The Last Child | Choose one Trade skill, +3 Int or +3 Fel |
| Born to Wealth | (No choice - direct +2 PF) |
| Far-Reaching Contacts | Choose three Peer talents |
| Perilous Choice | Choose one Psychic Discipline + one Technique |
| Proven to be Pure | (Astropaths: optional +200xp for technique) |
| Witch-knowledge | Choose one Forbidden Lore + one Peer |

### Profit Factor Tracking

Lineages affect starting Profit Factor:

| Modifier | Talents |
|----------|---------|
| +2 | Born to Wealth |
| +1 | My Great-Grandfather |
| -1 | Dark Secret, The One to Redeem Them |
| -2 | Another Generation of Shame |
