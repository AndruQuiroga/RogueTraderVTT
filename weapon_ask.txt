lets look into the attack dialog for weapons I want to rework the design of the attack options:
For weapons options/modifiers I want to have cards much like in the combat tab of the character sheet.
where users 'select' and highlight the options that apply to their attack. this will be much more intuitive and user friendly than the current drop down system.
lets make it sleek and clean and modern with nice animations and styles to make it fun and engaging to select the attack options.

these should all have tooltips much like the how the character sheet combat tab cards do to explain what each option does and when it applies.

range weapons should have these Attack options:
- standard attack [half action] (selected by default)
- semi-Auto (if weapon supports it) [Full Action]
- Full-Auto (if supported) [Full Action]
- Suppressing Fire [Full Action]
- Overwatch [Full Action]
they can only select one of these.

Aim options:
I also want a Aim section where a user can choose either
- No Aim (selected by default)
- Half Aim +10 [half action]
- Full Aim +20 [full action]
they can only select one of these.

Range options:
then a Range selection where it shows a meters where a user select a range:
- point blank [3m] +30
- half range +10
- standard range +0 (selected by default)
- long range (double) -10
- (extreme range (triple) -30).
make sure to put the meters in based on the weapon.
also have a utility to have the user 'auto select' by clicking on the token being attacked.

we need to also have a 'select all the apply situationally bonus/penity cards such as:
- prone -10 (for ranged attacks)
- unaware +30
- engaged in melee -20 (for ranged attacks)
- Darkness -30 (for ranged attacks)
- High Ground +10 (for ranged attacks)
- Stunned Target +20

then lets have a section for Size modifiers: (lets have this by default be collapsed not to clutter the UI but have a button to expand it if needed)
puny -20
Scrawny -10
Average +0 (selected by default)
Hulking +10
Enormous +20
Massive +30

Melee Weapons:

Melee weapons should have these Attack options:
- standard attack [half action] (selected by default)
- Charge [Full Action]
- All-Out Attack [Full Action]
- Guarded Attack [Full Action]
[Special options]
- Feint [Half Action]
- Knockdown [Half Action]
- Stun [Full Action]
- Maneuver [Half Action]
they can only select one of these, for special options should be collapsable and not to clutter the UI.

we need to also have a 'select all the apply situationally bonus/penity cards such as:
- prone +10 (for melee attacks)
- unaware +30
- Darkness -20 (for melee attacks)
- Ganging up +10 (for melee attacks)
- Stunned Target +20
