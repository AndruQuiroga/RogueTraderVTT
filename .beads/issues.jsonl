(Future) Proficiency display linked to actor's talents\n\n### Design Principles\n- Combat-first: Default view prioritizes what players need in combat\n- Edit mode toggle: Inspired by TalentSheetV2, but with modern UX\n- Clickable quality tags: Open compendium entries (like origin-path-builder grant-tags)\n- 3-tab minimal structure: Overview (combat), Properties (all editable), Effects\n- Sticky stat bar: Damage/Pen/Range/RoF/Clip visible above tabs\n\n### Technical Approach\n- ApplicationV2 with edit mode state (like TalentSheetV2)\n- DataModel prepareDerivedData() for modification stat aggregation\n- Reusable quality tag component pattern from origin-path-builder\n- Font Awesome 6 Pro icons throughout\n- Translucent, sleek styling matching talent/skill sheets\n\n### Breaking Changes (OK - not in production)\n- Remove overlapping class options (chain, power, shock, force -\u003e type only)\n- Potentially remove or repurpose proficiency field\n- Restructure modifications to embedded items with full stat integration","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"andru.quiroga.18@cnu.edu","created_at":"2026-01-19T22:46:59.576043131-05:00","created_by":"Andru Quiroga","updated_at":"2026-01-20T18:23:12.2635356-05:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"RogueTraderVTT-xak","depends_on_id":"RogueTraderVTT-goi","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-19T23:06:41.511205972-05:00","created_by":"Andru Quiroga"},{"issue_id":"RogueTraderVTT-xak","depends_on_id":"RogueTraderVTT-viw","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-19T23:06:42.203718074-05:00","created_by":"Andru Quiroga"},{"issue_id":"RogueTraderVTT-xak","depends_on_id":"RogueTraderVTT-6zd","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-20T18:26:12.5105679-05:00","created_by":"Aqui"},{"issue_id":"RogueTraderVTT-xak","depends_on_id":"RogueTraderVTT-7jb","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-20T18:26:12.7335693-05:00","created_by":"Aqui"},{"issue_id":"RogueTraderVTT-xak","depends_on_id":"RogueTraderVTT-q2w","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-20T18:26:12.9411266-05:00","created_by":"Aqui"},{"issue_id":"RogueTraderVTT-xak","depends_on_id":"RogueTraderVTT-yy9","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-20T18:26:13.1413244-05:00","created_by":"Aqui"}]}
