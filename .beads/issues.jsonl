lowest die\n- Proven(X): Damage rolls below X count as X (min damage)\n- Primitive(X): Damage rolls above X count as X (max damage, except RF)\n- Felling(X): Reduce Unnatural Toughness by X when calculating damage reduction\n- Melta: Double penetration at short range\n- Power Field: Increase damage/pen (in stats), 75% destroy enemy weapon on parry\n\n**Implementation:**\n- Extend damage formula generation in WeaponData\n- Add quality handlers in damage roll evaluation\n- Tearing: Custom dice roller (1d10 + 1d10 drop lowest)\n- Melta: Range-dependent penetration modifier\n- Felling: Modify target effective Toughness Bonus\n\n**Estimated Time:** 8-12 hours\n**Priority:** P1 (Tearing/Melta very common, high impact)\n**Depends On:** Range calculation system\n\n---\n\n### CATEGORY D: Complex Conditional Effects (Status/AoE)\n**Qualities:** Blast(X), Flame, Shocking, Toxic(X), Corrosive, Haywire(X), Smoke(X), Snare(X), Hallucinogenic(X)\n\n**Mechanical Effects:**\n- Blast(X): Area of Effect explosion, X metre radius, roll damage once, apply to all in radius\n- Flame: Target makes WP test or catches fire (ongoing damage)\n- Shocking: Target makes T test or stunned\n- Toxic(X): Target makes T test (-10*X) or takes additional damage/effects\n- Corrosive: Reduce AP of hit location by 1d10\n- Haywire(X): Effects X metre radius, damages electronics\n- Smoke(X): Creates X metre smoke screen lasting 1d10+10 rounds\n- Snare(X): Target makes Ag test (-10*X) or immobilized\n\n**Implementation:**\n- Create AoE targeting dialog for Blast/Haywire\n- Apply active effects for ongoing conditions (Flame, Snare)\n- Target selection for multi-target effects\n- Test prompts for saves (WP/T/Ag)\n- Condition tracking on actors\n\n**Estimated Time:** 20-30 hours (most complex category)\n**Priority:** P1 (Blast/Flame very common in explosives/flamers)\n**Depends On:** Active effects system, combat tracker, targeting system\n\n---\n\n### CATEGORY E: Advanced Roll Mechanics\n**Qualities:** Storm, Twin-Linked, Scatter, Lance, Overcharge, Maximal, Recharge, Gyro-Stabilised, Indirect\n\n**Mechanical Effects:**\n- Storm: Double hits and ammo when firing (2 hits per DoS, up to 2x RoF)\n- Twin-Linked: +20 to hit, use 2x ammo\n- Scatter: Point Blank (+10 hit, +3 dmg), Long+ (-3 dmg), range-dependent\n- Lance: Increase pen by base pen value per DoS after first\n- Overcharge: Expend 3x ammo for Concussive(2) OR increase damage by X\n- Maximal: Fire on maximal setting (different effect per weapon)\n- Recharge: Cannot fire if fired previous round\n- Gyro-Stabilised: Never counts as Extreme range, heavy weapon brace penalty -20 instead of -30\n- Indirect: Fire without line of sight with spotter, scatter on hit/miss\n\n**Implementation:**\n- Deep RoF integration (Storm, Twin-Linked)\n- Range bracket modifiers (Scatter, Gyro-Stabilised)\n- Penetration scaling (Lance)\n- Fire mode selection dialog (Overcharge, Maximal)\n- Round tracking (Recharge)\n- Targeting without LoS (Indirect)\n\n**Estimated Time:** 15-25 hours\n**Priority:** P1-P2 (Storm/Twin-Linked/Scatter common)\n**Depends On:** RoF system, Range brackets, Ammo tracking, Combat tracker\n\n---\n\n### CATEGORY F: Exotic/Unique Mechanics\n**Qualities:** Force, Warp Weapon, Witch-Edge, Living Ammunition, Daemonbane, Necron Wep, Unstable, Vengeful(X), Gauss, Razor-Sharp\n\n**Mechanical Effects:**\n- Force: Counts as Best Mono weapon for non-psykers, adds Psy Rating to pen/damage\n- Warp Weapon: Ignores cover and non-warded armour AP\n- Witch-Edge: Add 2x Strength Bonus to damage (Eldar with Secret of Seers)\n- Living Ammunition: Weapon grows/regenerates ammo (special rules)\n- Daemonbane: Special effects vs Daemons\n- Gauss: Righteous Fury on 9-10 (not just 10)\n- Vengeful(X): Righteous Fury on X or higher\n- Razor-Sharp: Special effect on 3+ DoS\n- Unstable: Special effect when weapon hits\n\n**Implementation:**\n- Psyker detection and Psy Rating integration (Force)\n- Armour penetration special cases (Warp Weapon)\n- Actor type detection (Daemonbane vs Daemons, Witch-Edge for Eldar)\n- Righteous Fury threshold modification (Gauss, Vengeful)\n- Degree of Success counting (Razor-Sharp)\n\n**Estimated Time:** 10-15 hours\n**Priority:** P2-P3 (rare qualities, niche cases)\n**Depends On:** Righteous Fury system, Actor type checking\n\n---\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- All Category A-B qualities functional\n- Tearing, Blast, Flame, Storm implemented (most common complex qualities)\n- Quality handler system extensible for future qualities\n- Test suite covering each quality mechanical effect\n- Documentation of quality implementation status\n- Chat card displays quality effects in attack results\n\n## Implementation
